Project Title: Streamlining Containerized Application Deployment on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Using Container Registry



1.	Overview of Containerized Application Deployment

This phase focuses on leveraging IBM Cloud's Kubernetes Service (IKS) and IBM Cloud Container Registry to streamline the deployment of containerized applications. The goal is to build an efficient, scalable, and automated pipeline that deploys containers from the IBM Cloud Container Registry to IBM Kubernetes clusters. Key activities will include containerizing applications, pushing images to the registry, deploying containers to Kubernetes, and automating these processes for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
Key Components:

∙	Containerization: Package applications into containers to achieve consistent, portable deployments.
∙	IBM Cloud Container Registry: Store and manage container images. ∙ IBM

Kubernetes Service (IKS): Orchestrate container deployment, scaling, and management with Kubernetes.
∙	Automation & CI/CD: Automate the build, push, and deployment pipeline for rapid and consistent application deployment.
2.	Configuring IBM Cloud Kubernetes and Container Registry

2.1	Steps to Set Up IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)

1.	Create an IBM Cloud Account & Log In:
o	Visit IBM Cloud and log in with your credentials.
o	If you do not have an IBM Cloud account, create one following the registration process.
2.	Provision the Kubernetes Cluster:

∙	Step 1: From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, navigate to Kubernetes.
∙	Step 2: Click Create Cluster and select your desired Region and Cluster Plan
 
(Standard or Free).
∙	Step 3: Choose the worker node type (e.g., Standard, Compute).
∙	Step 4: Once the cluster is created, configure the kubectl CLI tool to manage the cluster from your local machine.
∙	Use ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster-name> to configure the cluster in your terminal.
3.	Integrate IBM Cloud Container Registry (ICR):

∙	Navigate to Container Registry from the IBM Cloud Dashboard.

∙	Create a private registry for storing your container images.

∙	Note your Registry URL and Credentials to authenticate the Docker CLI for pushing images.
2.2	Containerizing Applications with Docker

1.	Create a Dockerfile: To containerize an application, create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. Below is an example for a Python Flask application:
FROM python:3.9-slim WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . /app

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

2.	Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the following command: docker build -t myapp:latest .
3.	Tag the Image for IBM Cloud Container Registry:
 
Tag the image for IBM Cloud Container Registry:

docker tag myapp:latest <REGISTRY_URL>/<namespace>/myapp:latest 4. Push the Docker Image to IBM Cloud Container Registry:
Authenticate Docker to IBM Cloud:

ibmcloud cr login

Push the image to your private registry:
docker push <REGISTRY_URL>/<namespace>/myapp:latest


3.	Deploying Containers on IBM Kubernetes

3.1	Create Kubernetes Deployment and Service

1.	Deployment YAML: Create a deployment.yaml file to define the deployment configuration for Kubernetes. Here's an example:
apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:
name: myapp-deployment spec:
replicas: 3 selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp spec:
containers:
-	name: myapp
image: <REGISTRY_URL>/<namespace>/myapp:latest ports:
-	containerPort: 5000

2.	Service YAML: To expose the application, create a service.yaml file:
 
yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:
name: myapp-service spec:
selector:
app: myapp ports:
- protocol: TCP port: 80
targetPort: 5000 type: LoadBalancer


3.	Deploy to Kubernetes: Apply the YAML files to deploy your application:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml kubectl apply -f service.yaml
4.	Verify Deployment: To check the status of the deployment:

kubectl get pods kubectl get svc


4.	Automating the Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

4.1	Integrating with IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery

1.	Create a Delivery Pipeline:
o	From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, navigate to Continuous Delivery. o Create a new pipeline that will automatically build and deploy the containerized application to your Kubernetes cluster whenever a change is pushed to your GitHub repository.
2.	Pipeline Configuration:
o	Step 1: Add a Build stage to build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in your repository.
o	Step 2: Add a Deploy stage to deploy the image to your IBM Kubernetes
 
cluster using kubectl.
3.	Trigger the Pipeline:
o	Set up the pipeline to trigger on code commits to the repository (e.g., via GitHub webhook).
5.	User Interface Development for Monitoring and Management

To monitor and manage your Kubernetes deployments, consider integrating tools like IBM Cloud Monitoring or Prometheus with Grafana for custom dashboards.
1.	Set Up IBM Cloud Monitoring:
o	Use the IBM Cloud Monitoring service to track the health of your Kubernetes clusters and deployed applications.
o	Set up custom alerts to notify you in case of failures, resource exhaustion, or scaling issues.
2.	Prometheus and Grafana:
o	You can install Prometheus and Grafana on your Kubernetes cluster to monitor performance and create interactive dashboards.
6.	IBM Cloud Platform Features and Considerations

∙	Scalability: IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) supports auto-scaling to handle fluctuating

workloads, while IBM Cloud Container Registry can scale to accommodate large container images.
∙	Security: Use IBM Cloud IAM to manage access and implement fine-grained policies for container image access.
∙	Monitoring: IBM Cloud provides Monitoring and Log Management services to help

track the performance and health of both the registry and the Kubernetes clusters. ∙ Cost

Efficiency: Optimize the use of compute resources with auto-scaling in Kubernetes and use different storage classes to control costs.
